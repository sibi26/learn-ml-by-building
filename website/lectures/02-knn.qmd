subtitle: "Framing Prediction Problems & Instance-Based Learning"

## Overview

In this hands-on lecture, we tackle a real problem: **finding compatible ML project teammates** using k-Nearest Neighbors. Yes, you'll actually use this system to form your project teams! We'll explore how to frame real-world problems as ML tasks, understand the elegance of lazy learning, and confront the challenges of high-dimensional spaces.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- **Frame** real-world problems as ML tasks with inputs (X) and outputs (y)
- **Apply** k-NN for classification and regression tasks
- **Analyze** the impact of distance metrics and feature scaling
- **Understand** the curse of dimensionality and its practical implications
- **Design** fair and effective matching systems with domain constraints
- **Evaluate** trade-offs between different similarity measures

## 🎮 Team Matcher Visualization
Experience k-NN in action with our **[Interactive Team Matching Demo](https://github.com/jinming99/learn-ml-by-building/tree/main/Lecture%202%20KNN/project-matchmaker)**

This real-time visualization lets you:

- Adjust k parameter and see immediate effects
- Explore different dimension pairs 
- View how proximity translates to similarity
- Discover natural clustering patterns in the class

## Key Topics

1. **The Data Journey**: From text surveys → NLP features → 8D vectors
2. **k-NN Fundamentals**: The beautiful simplicity of "you are your neighbors"
3. **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine, and when each matters
4. **Curse of Dimensionality**: When all points become equidistant
5. **Fairness in ML**: Ensuring inclusive team formation
