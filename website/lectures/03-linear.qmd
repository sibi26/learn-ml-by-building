## Overview

Linear regression is far more powerful than its name suggests. In this hands-on lecture, we'll discover how the same algorithm that fits straight lines can capture complex curved relationships in real-world data. Through interactive experiments with automotive engineering and weather forecasting datasets, you'll master polynomial features, understand the "lifting technique," and learn when models become too complex.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- **Understand** linear regression model, parameters, and MSE loss function
- **Master** polynomial features through hands-on interaction
- **Apply** regression to real problems (automotive MPG, weather bias correction)
- **Visualize** the "lifting technique" that transforms curves into hyperplanes
- **Recognize** overfitting and understand model complexity trade-offs
- **Engineer** domain-specific features that outperform blind polynomial expansion
